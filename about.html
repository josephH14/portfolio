        My name is Joseph Hill and im an aspiring web designer and coder. Growing up as a kid I always played video games and like
        computers. My love for video games and computers made me want to be a video game designer but soon I started to branch
        off to web design. I didn't let my lack of resources stop me from learning how to code. Whether it be at school or
        the library i would use the computers to verse myself in coding. Years later and i got my own computer and i would
        spend hours trying to code but i had trouble just learning by myself. Soon I attended a mini hackathon named code
        day and it lit the fuse for me and code even more because i learned so much and networked with many great people
        who had a passion for coding just like me. Now I take classes at claim academy and plan to go far in the web design
        or even video game design market.
